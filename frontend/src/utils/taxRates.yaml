# Tax rates by fiscal year
# Each fiscal year has residential and commercial tax rates per $1,000 of assessed value
# 
# HOW TO ADD NEW FISCAL YEAR RATES:
# 1. Add a new entry under 'taxRates' with the fiscal year as the key
# 2. Provide both 'residential' and 'commercial' rates
# 3. Rates should be the tax amount per $1,000 of assessed value
# 
# Example:
#   2027:
#     residential: 12.00
#     commercial: 26.50
#
# The application will automatically use these rates when the fiscal year is selected.
# If a fiscal year is not found, it will fall back to the defaultRates.
