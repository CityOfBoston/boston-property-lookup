# Fiscal Year Configuration Data
# This file contains all fiscal year-specific data including tax rates and owner disclaimer dates
# 
# STRUCTURE:
# Each fiscal year contains:
# - taxRates: Residential and commercial tax rates (per $1,000 of assessed value)
# - ownerDisclaimerDates: Dates when owner information was last updated (changes Q1 & Q3)
#
# HOW TO ADD A NEW FISCAL YEAR:
# 
# Add a new entry under 'fiscalYears' with the fiscal year as the key:
# Example:
#   2027:
#     taxRates:
#       residential: 12.00
#       commercial: 26.50
#     ownerDisclaimerDates:
#       q1: "April 25, 2026"    # Used July 1, 2026 - December 31, 2026
#       q3: "October 25, 2026"  # Used January 1, 2027 - June 30, 2027
#
# QUARTERLY SCHEDULE:
# - Q1 (July 1 - December 31): First half of fiscal year, uses q1 disclaimer date
# - Q3 (January 1 - June 30): Second half of fiscal year, uses q3 disclaimer date
#
# FUTURE DATE HANDLING:
# For dates beyond the configured fiscal years, the system automatically uses:
# - Latest configured fiscal year's tax rates
# - Latest Q3 disclaimer date (most recent update)
# This prevents errors when using the TimeChanger to select future dates.
